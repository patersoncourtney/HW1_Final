    <h3>One of the safest, friendliest places in the world!</h3>
    <p>
    I travelled to Tel Aviv, Israel in May for a legal negotiations course through Northwestern Law School.
    A lot of people think that Israel is unsafe given recent conflict with neighboring countries.
    However, it was the safest I felt travelling in a really long time.
    The people were warm, inviting, and respectful, and the food was remarkable.
    I especially enjoyed the beaches during 95 degree weather!
